These are the deep learning experiments I conducted when studying deep learning. I am currently building a German/English translator using LSTM and I am implementing the transformer in Pytorch from scratch. I also learned to build an RNN model to classify a name's country of origin and a convolutional network to classifying clothing images. These projects were made with the help of the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*, websites such as Machine Learning Mastery, and the official websites of Pytorch and Tensorflow.
